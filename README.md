# Description
This project was an attempt to build an AR datacenter, so that the administrators need not log into every device to observe data about devices in their environments. Rather, the idea was to augment the administrator's reality in such a way that device data could readibly be seen to the administrators.

This is built off of aframe.io, utilizing javascript plugin and A-frames to create augmented reality. In my project, I set out to-do a few more things on top of this, which was to create a Python script to pull data out of PRTG (network monitor), so that data could be saved into an A-Frame <a-text> with the real-time data. This would allow me to load the new html text tag into the A-Frame object into a real-time fasion to update the data being displayed on the front-end.
